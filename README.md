# Yahtzee

## Description
This is a 2 - 5 player terminal version of Yahtzee that I created over a couple days of coding. The game itself should allow for the usual rules of Yahtzee. This includes bonus scoring for scores higher than 63 in the upper section and bonus Yahtzees. 

This was coded and uploaded after roughly two weeks of coding experience/practice. Any feedback/bugfinds are appreciated!

## Installation
1. Ensure you have ruby installed on you system --> [Check here for installation instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

2. Download or clone repo onto your machine

3. Open your terminal and navigate into the src directory

4. Once inside the src directory, run:
   
   `> ruby init.rb`

5. Enjoy! 

## Planned Changes

-- Add rules

-- Better Dice Roll UI

-- Sleepfunc & Animations

-- Fix P1 & P2 bug

-- Add single player mode

-- Try adding gems for animation

-- Refactor code to better reflect DRY principle

-- Evaluate links between the Game and Player 
class. Do I need to pass as much data between the two?

-- Maybe change "select dice to keep" to "select dice to roll"
